# Dog Breed Classifier
---

In this project I used Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques for identifying the breed of a dog presented on image. 

The goal was to build a pipeline which gives high accuracy predicting the canineâ€™s breed. 
Then wrap the code into web application and finally deploy it to the public web server.

At the moment, the application is available [here](http://alobov.pythonanywhere.com/). 
And the output looks something like this:

The first goal was achieved by using transfer learning. I took the model with superhuman performance aka ResNet50, 
cut off the top layer, froze the weights and added a layer with only 133 outputs which are supposed to represent canine's breeds. 
Then I trained this new network on a few dataset to get new weights for the top layer. 
It gave me 82% of accuracy in very few epochs what was quite enough.

For the web framework i have chosen Flask which is really easy to understand yet a very powerful tool. 

Then I tried to deploy it on github pages, but it didn't want to work for some reason. So I deployed it on pythonanywhere.com
